Sucury - Snake game challenge
==============================

Coral is an implementation exercise based on KobraPy open-source coding exercise. 

The software is a simple version of the classic 1980s arcade snake game, written in Python 
and implemented as an extension of the original KobraPy codebase. The project was developed 
in 2023 by Computer Science students taking the Open Source Systems undergraduate course 
at ICMC, University of São Paulo.
